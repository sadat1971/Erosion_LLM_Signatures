Placeholder for out paper: `The Erosion of LLM Signatures: Can We Still Distinguish Human and LLM-Generated Scientific Ideas After Iterative Paraphrasing?`

The paper shows Models can tell human vs. LLM ideas, but accuracy drops \~25% after repeated paraphrasing. Adding research context helps a bit, while simplified non-expert rewrites erase most LLM traces.
